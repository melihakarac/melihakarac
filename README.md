# 👋 Hi, I’m Meliha

I’m a **React-focused developer** who enjoys building clean, intuitive user interfaces and turning ideas into reliable, maintainable code.

I started out drawn to creative fields like photography and painting, and eventually found that same creativity in coding - designing components, structuring logic, and refining user experience.

## 🛠 Tech I work with
- **React** (hooks, state management, reusable components)
- **TypeScript**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- HTML & CSS
- Basic backend knowledge (APIs, data flow, integration)

---

## 💡 What I care about
- Writing **clear, readable code**
- Building UIs that feel **simple and intentional**
- Understanding *why* something works, not just *how*
- Continuous learning and improving fundamentals

---

## 🌱 Currently
- Deepening my React & TypeScript fundamentals  
- Improving code structure and real-world problem solving  
- Building small projects to refine UI and logic decisions

## 🎨 Fun facts about me
- I’m a **creative geek** at heart. I love capturing memories through my **camera lens** 📸  
- I design **awesome Minecraft builds** and bring ideas to life block by block 🏰  
- I dabble in **World of Warcraft transmogs**, crafting whimsical outfits and characters 🧙‍♀️✨  
- I find inspiration for coding and design in **art, games, and real-world experiences**
