# 👋 Hi, I’m Meliha

I’m a **React-focused developer** who loves building clean, intuitive UIs and turning ideas into reliable, maintainable code. I started out in creative fields like photography and painting, and found the same joy in coding - designing components, structuring logic, and refining experiences.

---

## 🛠 Tech I work with
- **React** (hooks, state management, reusable components)
- **TypeScript & JavaScript (ES6+)**
- HTML & CSS
- Basic backend knowledge (APIs, data flow, integration)

---

## 🌱 Currently
Diving deeper into **full-stack development** while leveraging **AI tools to accelerate problem-solving, streamline workflows, and craft smarter solutions**.

---

## 🎨 Fun fact
I'm a creative geek who captures memories through my camera lens, builds epic Minecraft worlds block by block, and explores the vast, beautiful Azeroth while hunting down whimsical transmogs - all while dreaming up ways to turn that same imagination into clean, clever code.
